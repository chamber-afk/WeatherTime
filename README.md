WeatherTime App made using XCode software (Swift language).
The app is an ios app works in apple devices but this is mainly for iphone only.
When you click on the Search button an the splash screen (1st Screeen) app will navigate to main screen.
Main screen has a search bar, country flag, country name, currrent date and time of the searched country, condition icon and temperature label.
The main screen also changes the background image according to the weather of the country.
For the data of the country name, temperature and condition icon , I have used openWeathermap API,
 for the date and time I have used in built functions and,
 for the flag I have used restcountries.com.
